# make_users_list

This Python script will creat a usernames list, helpful in many cases, for example in a Pentest when you find out how naming conventions are set, you can use the script to create a username list for Bruteforcing or whatever you want.

This will make a usernames list with the options of 
  - First name.last name
  - First initial.Last name
  - Last name.First inital
  - Last name.First initial
  
Still needs some fixes, untill I fix it, be sure to create the female names as "Female.txt"

All suggestions and recommendations are welcome :)
